working with what i have - <br>
- i pretty much got that i NEED to get a raspberry pi desperately <br>
- parts that come with bin <br>
- custom pcb with leftover money from onboard grant <br>
- old android phones collecting dust that do not work / barely work which can be dissected for parts without alarming my parents

<br><br>

okay so my objective was, for the near-ish future, to make the following - <br>
- macropad (using pi pico) <br>
- cyberdeck / portable computer using raspberry pi <br>
- hosting my own cloud server using raspberry pi <br>
<br>

what i quickly found out for this was that -
- i do NOT have the skills for this. not at all. this is all very advanced stuff and requires years of experience. i need to aim smaller, change the goal, be realistic. <br>
